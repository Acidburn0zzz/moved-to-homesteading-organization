      Nate said: I built that shelf myself. Could you imagine if I found a shelf that was perfectly built for 800 old school NES games? That'd be weird, huh? Oh, and here's a little update...I only need 14 games now: one licensed game (stadium events) and 13 unlicensed. For the list go here (<a href="http://n8duke.wordpress.com/nes-games-im-after/" title="NES Games I&#8217;m After &laquo; The Life of N8">http://n8duke.wordpress.com/nes-games-im-after/</a>).
